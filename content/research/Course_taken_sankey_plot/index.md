This Sankey diagram visually represents the course selection pathways for students from 8th to 12th grade in mathematics. Starting from the left, different math courses such as "Algebra I," "Geometry," and categories like "NA" (Not Available or Not Applicable) and "No Math" indicate the initial status of the students. These categories represent the starting points for the students' journey through math education over these grades.

The flows (represented by the grey bands) in the diagram depict the transitions of students from one math course or status to another. The width of these flows signifies the number of students making each transition; broader flows indicate a larger number of students moving along that path.

As you move from left to right across the diagram, you can see the subsequent math courses students enroll in, culminating in advanced courses like "Precalculus" and "AP/IB Calculus," as well as students who continue to remain in the "NA" or "No Math" categories.

The Sankey diagram clearly demonstrates the pathways of student progression from foundational to advanced math courses, including the major transition patterns between different math courses. For example, it highlights the diversity of paths taken by students after completing "Algebra I," with some moving directly to "Algebra II," while others shift to "Geometry" or other branches of math.
