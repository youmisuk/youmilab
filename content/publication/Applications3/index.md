abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning methods for causal inference to estimate the average treatment effect and the conditional average treatment effects. The purposes of this paper are to introduce machine learning methods for causal inference and to investigate the effects of school club activities on students’ collaborative competency using one particular machine learning method based on random forests, called ‘casual forests’. Specifically, this paper uses causal forests to estimate the average effect and heterogeneous effects of school club activities on students' collaborative competency. As a result, we found that the average effect of school club participation is significantly positive, and this finding highlights the importance of school club activities as a complement to subject-centered curriculum to enhance students’ social development. Our additional analysis found that there are no significant, heterogeneous treatment effects depending on gender, peer relationship, and teacher-student relationship.
