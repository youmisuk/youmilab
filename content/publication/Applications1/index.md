abstract: 
Background-There is mixed evidence about the relations of current versus past cancer with severe COVID-19 outcomes and how they vary by patient and cancer characteristics. Methods-Electronic health record data of 104,590 adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19 were obtained from 21 United States health systems from February 2020 through September 2021. In-hospital mortality and ICU admission were predicted from current and past cancer diagnoses. Moderation by patient characteristics, vaccination status, cancer type, and year of the pandemic was examined.Results-6.8% of the patients had current (n = 7,141) and 6.5% had past (n = 6,749) cancer diagnoses. Current cancer predicted both severe outcomes but past cancer did not; adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for mortality were 1.58 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.46–1.70] and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.96–1.13), respectively. Mortality rates decreased over the pandemic but the incremental risk of current cancer persisted, with the increment being larger among younger vs. older patients. Prior COVID-19 vaccination reduced mortality generally and among those with current cancer (aOR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.90). Conclusions-Current cancer, especially among younger patients, posed a substantially increased risk for death and ICU admission among patients with COVID-19; prior COVID-19 vaccination mitigated the risk associated with current cancer. Past history of cancer was not associated with higher risks for severe COVID-19 outcomes for most cancer types. Impact-This study clarifies the characteristics that modify the risk associated with cancer on severe COVID-19 outcomes across the first 20 months of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Hospitalized adult patients with current cancer are at increased relative risk for severe COVID-19 disease and death, a pattern manifest across the duration of the pandemic. The magnitude of the incremental risk associated with current cancer varies with age and is greatest among younger patients. Moreover, a history of most types of cancer (versus current cancer) did not place those infected with COVID-19 at higher risk for severe outcomes. Information on risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes in cancer populations may inform clinician and patient decision making regarding COVID-19 treatment and prevention. The finding that prior COVID-19 vaccination was associated with reduced risk of death for all hospitalized patients with COVID-19, including those with current cancer, supports an increased urgency to vaccinate individuals with cancer (1, 27).
