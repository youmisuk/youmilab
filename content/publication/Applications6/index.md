abstract: Multilevel latent class analysis and mixture propensity score models have been implemented to account for heterogeneous selection mechanisms and for proper causal inference with observational multilevel data (Kim & Steiner in Quantitative Psychology Research. Springer, Cham, pp. 293–306, 2015). The scenarios imply the existence of multiple selection classes, and if class membership is unknown, homogeneous classes can be usually identified via multilevel logistic latent class models. Although latent class random-effects logistic models are frequently used, linear models and fixed-effects models can be alternatives for identifying multiple selection classes and estimating class-specific treatment effects (Kim & Suk in Specifying Multilevel Mixture Models in Propensity Score Analysis. International Meeting of Psychometric Society, New York, 2018). Using the Korea TIMSS 2015 eighth-grade student data, this study examined the potentially heterogeneous treatment effects of private science lessons by inspecting multiple selection classes (e.g., different motivations to receive the lessons) using four types of selection models-- random-effects logistic, random-effects linear, fixed-effects logistic, and fixed-effects linear models. Implications of identifying selection classes in casual inference with multilevel assessment data are discussed.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In summary, this paper addresses selection model heterogeneity and treatment effect heterogeneity in PS analysis as a problem of subpopulations that may behave in selection processes differently and receive benefits of a treatment differently. The problem of selection model heterogeneity is closely associated with a problem of model specifications of latent class multilevel modeling. At present, the main approach to addressing the model specifications of latent class multilevel modeling is through exploring three alternatives to the conventional RE LOGIT. Thus, our paper accomplishes two goals. First, we provide an empirical example when within-class matching effectively worked. Again, the within-class matching retains the advantages of within-cluster and across-cluster matching and minimizes the disadvantages of both. This within-class matching is capable of explaining what is going on in subgroups more informatively. Second, we provide empirical evidence for Kim and Suk (2018)’s alternative model approaches of multilevel mixture selection models in PS analysis by addressing the problem of model specification for within-class matching. Using alternatives and comparing them with a baseline are of help to the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects with multilevel assessment data, which is our goal. To conclude, we offer a multilevel mixture modeling approach in PS analysis that accounts for selection model heterogeneity and the corresponding treatment effect heterogeneity and that can be adopted by those who wish to do causal inference with multilevel assessment data.
